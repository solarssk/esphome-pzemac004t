# ESPHome + PZEM-004T (v3)

This project provides an ESPHome configuration for monitoring electrical parameters using the PZEM-004T (v3) module and an ESP8266 (e.g., ESP-01). This setup allows for real-time tracking of energy consumption within a smart home environment.

## üì¶ Hardware Requirements

- **ESP8266**: Such as the ESP module.
- **PZEM-004T v3**: Single-phase energy meter for measuring voltage, current, power, and energy.
- **Home Assistant**: With ESPHome integration for seamless monitoring and control.

## üîå Wiring Instructions

**Important**: Ensure all wiring is performed with the power turned off to prevent electrical hazards.

1. **Power Connections**:
   - Connect the `5V` pin on the PZEM-004T to the `5V` pin on the ESP8266.
   - Connect the `GND` pin on the PZEM-004T to the `GND` pin on the ESP8266.

2. **UART Communication**:
   - Connect the `TX` pin on the PZEM-004T to the `RX` pin on the ESP8266.
   - Connect the `RX` pin on the PZEM-004T to the `TX` pin on the ESP8266.

3. **Energy Measurement**:
   - For the 100A version of the PZEM-004T, attach the external current transformer (CT) around the live wire of the circuit you wish to monitor. Ensure the orientation of the CT is correct, following the manufacturer's guidelines.

## üìÅ Files in This Repository

- `pzmac004t.yaml`: Main ESPHome configuration file.
- `secrets.yaml` (not included): Contains your Wi-Fi credentials and other sensitive information.

## üîê Sample `secrets.yaml`

Create a `secrets.yaml` file in your ESPHome directory with the following content:

```yaml
wifi_ssid: "YourWiFiSSID"
wifi_password: "YourWiFiPassword"
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Overview
- **UART Interface**: Facilitates Modbus communication with the PZEM-004T.
- **Sensors Exposed**:
  - Voltage (V)
  - Current (A) Ôøº
  - Power (W) Ôøº
  - Energy (kWh)
  - Frequency (Hz)
  - Power Factor (%) Ôøº
- **Web Interface**: Enabled on port 80 for real-time monitoring.
- **OTA Updates**: Supports over-the-air updates for easy maintenance.
- **Home Assistant Integration**: Seamless integration via the native API.

## üöÄ Usage Instructions

1. **Flashing the Firmware**:
   - Use ESPHome to compile and upload the pzmac004t.yaml configuration to your ESP8266 device.

2. **Hardware Setup**:
   - Connect the PZEM-004T module to the ESP8266 as per the wiring instructions above.
   - Install the current transformer (if using the 100A version) around the live wire of the circuit to be monitored.

3. **Integration with Home Assistant**:
   - Once the ESP8266 is online and connected to your Wi-Fi network, Home Assistant should automatically detect the new ESPHome device.
   - Add the device through the Home Assistant interface to start monitoring the electrical parameters.
